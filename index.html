        <ul>
            <li><h3><b>What was done for each viewport</b></h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The top left viewport includes the use of multiple models, all of the major matrics, and involves an XWing, flying to a new planet surrounded by meteorites.</li>
                <li>The top right viewport makes use of translation, it's godzilla doing a slide kick.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insert funny gif here:
                        <div>

                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>The bottom left demostrates scaling, a teapot that scales</li>
                <li>Finally, the bottom right demostrates rotate, a planet that is rotating in the scene</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3><b>SHADERS</b></h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In this case, I made a simple shader and modified the edge color everytime an object was displayed, each object has a defined color in their class. Nothing terribly complicated.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3><b>Credits</b></h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Made by Joseph Graves for Computer Graphics.</li>
